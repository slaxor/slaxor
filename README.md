# Hi,

I’m Sascha Teske (internetwise known as @slaxor).
I live (mostly) in Hamburg. I own a tiny business 
(Microprojects GmbH) that creates software for not
so tiny businesses. We also help them to find out
what they really need and how they can achieve 
their goals. 

- I’m interested in far too many things for my own good.
  - outdoors 
    - wildlife
    - cycling
    - hiking
    - snowboarding
    - kite surfing
  - indoors
    - music
    - electronics
    - embedded systems
    - microcontrollers
    - 3d printing
    - linux
    - french horn and it siblings
    - go (the game)
    - go (the lang)
    - 
- I’m currently learning a lot about renewable energy (solar, wind, batteries for storage etc.)
- I’m looking for people in my area play music. My horns are about to gather dust.
- Drop me an email @ sascha.teske@gmail.com
